# A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of the Human Pancreas

This repository contains the final project for the study of single-cell transcriptomic data from the human pancreas. The goal of the project is to analyze and visualize cellular heterogeneity, gene expression patterns, and biological insights using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods.

## Repository Contents

* **Final\_project.rmd**
  Main R Markdown script with the complete analysis workflow, including data preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and interpretation.

* **GSE85241_dataset.csv.gz**
  Processed dataset used in the analysis. 

* **Presentation**
  A slide deck summarizing the key findings, figures, and conclusions from the analysis.

* **Publication draft**
  A detailed written report presenting the methodology, results, and discussion of the study, structured as a scientific publication.

## Key Features

* Single-cell RNA-seq data exploration and preprocessing
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE/UMAP)
* Cell type clustering and annotation
* Marker gene identification
* Visualization of expression profiles across pancreatic cell types
* Biological interpretation of the findings


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juliaszkop/A-Single-Cell-Transcriptomic-Atlas-of-the-Human-Pancreas.git
   cd A-Single-Cell-Transcriptomic-Atlas-of-the-Human-Pancreas
   ```

2. Open `Final_project.rmd` in RStudio.

3. Knit the R Markdown file to reproduce the full analysis and figures.

4. Explore the presentation and report for summarized results and interpretation.
